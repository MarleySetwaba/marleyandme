**Understanding Generics in Semi Dynamic Response Structures**


```
//base response
type BaseResponse = {
    code: number;
    message: string;
}

//resource can be items, sales etc

//Generic Response
type GenericResourceResponse<T extends string> = BaseResponse & Partial<Record<T, any>>

//items response
const items_response: GenericResourceResponse<'items'> = {
    code: 1,
    message: 'success',
    items: {
        id: '354',
        name: 'Earphones',
        price: 200

    }
}

//sales response
const sales_response: GenericResourceResponse<'sales'> = {
code: 1,
message: 'success',
sales: {
    id: 1,
    item_id: '354',
    sales_price: 250
}
}

//failed response for expenses
const failed_response: GenericResourceResponse<'expenses'> = {
    code: 0,
    message: 'failed',

}


```

**Core Concept:**
- **Flexibility:** The primary goal is to create a versatile response structure that can accommodate various data types without compromising type safety.
- **Generic Type `T`:** This allows us to dynamically specify the key of the additional property.
- **`Partial<Record<T, any>>`:** This part is crucial. It ensures that the property with the key `T` is optional and can hold any value.

**Breakdown:**

1. **`BaseResponse`:**
   - This is a simple interface defining a basic response structure with `code` and `message` properties.

2. **`GenericResourceResponse`:**
   - **Extends `BaseResponse`:** Inherits the `code` and `message` properties.
   - **`Partial<Record<T, any>>`:**
     - `Record<T, any>`: Creates an object with a single property. The property's key is `T` (the dynamic key) and its value can be anything.
     - `Partial`: Makes the entire object optional. This means the dynamic property and its value can be absent.

**Example:**

```typescript
const itemsResponse: GenericResourceResponse<'items'> = {
  code: 200,
  message: 'Items fetched successfully',
  items: [
    { id: 1, name: 'Product A' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Product B' }
  ]
};

const salesResponse: GenericResourceResponse<'sales'> = {
  code: 200,
  message: 'Sales data retrieved',
  sales: {
    totalSales: 10000,
    topProduct: 'Product A'
  }
};
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Type Safety:** Ensures that the dynamic property exists only when specified and has the correct type.
- **Flexibility:** Can accommodate various response structures without creating multiple specific response types.
- **Code Reusability:** Centralizes common response properties and dynamic data handling.
- **Improved Code Readability:** Clearer intent and easier to understand the potential structure of the response.

By understanding the combination of generic types, interface inheritance, and partial types, you can create powerful and flexible response structures in your TypeScript applications.
os, making your TypeScript code more flexible and adaptable. By using generic types and the `Partial` and `Record` types, you can create dynamic responses that can be easily extended and modified.
