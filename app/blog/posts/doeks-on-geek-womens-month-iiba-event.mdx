# Doeks On Geek: Celebrating Women In Tech And Business Analysis

Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the IIBA South Africa Chapter's #DoeksOnGeek panel. This event was a powerful platform to explore the fascinating intersection of feminine culture and technology, two worlds often perceived as separate.

[Nombuso Gumede's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nombuso-gumede-63675537/) keynote theme, "Bridging Cultural Identity (‘Doeks’) and Tech Expertise (‘Geek’): Navigating the Intersection of Heritage and Technology," set the stage for a rich and thought-provoking discussion.

[Paulinah Teffu's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulinah-teffu-mba-gibs-51a32117/) emphasis on empathy as a driving force for change resonated deeply with me. Her insights underscored the importance of understanding and valuing diverse perspectives in creating inclusive and effective work environments. 

[Fiona Oakley-Smith's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fionaoakleysmith/) inspiring journey was a testament to resilience and determination, reminding us that our backgrounds can be a source of strength.

## Lessons Learned:

The #DoeksOnGeek panel was an extraordinary experience that offered a wealth of insights into the complex relationship between feminine culture and technology. Beyond the inspiring conversations and shared experiences, I walked away with several key lessons that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors.

**1. The Power of Empathy:** 
Paulinah Teffu's emphasis on empathy as a cornerstone of effective leadership resonated deeply. In a world increasingly driven by technology, it's easy to become detached from the human element. Understanding and responding to the needs and perspectives of others is essential for building strong teams and fostering innovation. 

**2. The Importance of Diversity and Inclusion:**
The panel highlighted the critical role of diversity in creating a thriving tech industry. By embracing different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives, we can foster innovation, problem-solving, and a more equitable workplace. It's imperative to create inclusive environments where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their unique talents. 

**3. The Strength of Mentorship:**
Mentorship emerged as a powerful theme throughout the panel. Sharing knowledge, experiences, and support can be transformative for aspiring professionals. Investing time in mentoring the next generation of tech leaders is not only fulfilling but also essential for the growth of the industry.

**4. The Intersection of Heritage and Technology:**
Nombuso Gumede explored the concept of bridging cultural identity and tech expertise. The panel further reinforced the idea that our heritage can be a source of inspiration and innovation. By embracing our cultural roots, we can bring fresh perspectives and unique solutions to the challenges facing the tech industry.

**5. The Journey of Self-Discovery:**
Participating in the panel was a personal journey of self-discovery. Sharing my experiences and perspectives with others helped me gain new insights into my own values and aspirations. It's essential to continuously reflect on our journey and seek opportunities for growth and development.

The #DoeksOnGeek panel was a catalyst for meaningful conversations and a reminder of the power of collective action. By embracing these lessons and working together, we can create a future where technology is a force for good and benefits everyone. 

The #DoeksOnGeek panel was a powerful reminder that our cultural heritage and our passion for technology are not mutually exclusive. By embracing our diversity and fostering inclusive environments, we can create a future where innovation thrives. It was an honor to share this platform with such inspiring women and to contribute to a conversation that is essential for the growth of our industry.

I extend my sincere gratitude to the [IIBA South Africa Chapter](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iiba-south-africa-chapter/) for organizing this event and to my team members for their insightful contributions. Together, we are building a stronger, more inclusive tech community.
